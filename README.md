Prompt Engineering Portfolio
This repository showcases my work in Prompt Engineering and demonstrates my skills in AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML). I have worked on projects that involve designing prompts for large language models, improving interaction with AI, and enhancing the response quality in various use cases.

Skills
Prompt Engineering: Creating and refining prompts for effective AI responses.

AI/ML: Implementing machine learning algorithms and models to solve real-world problems.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Working with text data and developing models for text classification, sentiment analysis, and language generation.

Data Analysis: Handling data sets, performing data cleaning, and analyzing results to improve model performance.

Projects
AI-Powered Chatbot:
Designed and implemented a chatbot using large language models (LLMs) that can carry out intelligent conversations. The project focuses on generating conversational prompts and analyzing responses for improved user experience.
